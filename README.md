This is a for Coding Dojo Bootcamp May 2022 - CSS section - Position Section 

This one was interesting for me
I struggled in the first go at it
I finished but was not happy about it
I went to bed, and in the middle of the night I woke up, remembering about the Flexbox Froggy game and how to do it

At 2 am I got up and redid the whole project using more flexbox
To do that, I first had to read about branching in GitHub
I learned how to made a branch, clone it, do a pull request and a merge
All in all, a great learning experience
It took a lot of time but I'm happy with what I got out of it
