This is a for Coding Dojo Bootcamp May 2022 - CSS section - Position Section 

This one was interesting for me.<br/>
I struggled in the first go with it.<br/>
I knew to do the poisitioning part but forgot to incorporate more flexbox.<br/>
I finished the assignment, but was not happy about it, and did not submit it.<br/>
I went to bed, and in the middle of the night I woke up, remembering about the Flexbox Froggy game and then new how I wanted do it.

At 2 am I got up and redid the whole project using more flexbox.<br/>
To do that, I first had to read about branching in GitHub.<br/>
I learned how to made a branch, clone it, do a pull request and a merge.<br/>
All in all, a great learning experience.<br/>
It took a lot of time but I'm happy with what I got out of it.
